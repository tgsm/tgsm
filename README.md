# hey, kiddo.
I'm Thomas, aka tgsm. My main development interests are systems emulation and game decompilation.

## What I'm currently working on
  I'm working on a [Gameboy emulator](https://github.com/tgsm/heliage) and a [Gameboy Advance emulator](https://github.com/tgsm/heliage-advance), both in C++.
